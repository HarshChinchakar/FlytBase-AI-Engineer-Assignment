#Requirements and Understanding the project
Can use Ai assistants - Noted points --> using them for research, Potential approach mapping, pipeline optimization, code optimization. 

Problem statement - 
Develo[ing a Drone security Analyst agent 
Given - Docked drone (1-perspective camera assumption)
               access to live telemetry data (cordinates, altitude) - basically drone location governance
                Live video feed
                 
To do - 
1. Process --> Telemetry data and video frames
2. Analysis of video --> Object detection (event basis) 
3. log generation
4. Alert system
5. Inclusion of cross domain element
6. Create test cases for validation
7. Information retrival (Keyword search, Time search, Relevance search)
8. Testing Documentation (System Validation)
9. videoprocessing, context summaries, agent recommendations, scalability test, and
    innovative features (e.g., show frame descriptions, agent output, generated
    captions).
10. Implement a video summarization feature 
11. Agentic Chatbot (followup questions)
12. Sudden changes in telementry data --> flag as security threat (Drone damaged/technical issue)

Problem statement flow (Initial Ideating phase) 
1. Realtime Detection (object detection [implement event detection] + analysis of security events 
    Breakdown :- Feed --> flagging security events (Detection) + Video (frame-by-frame/event-b-event) analysis + 

2. Object Identification --> Event (activity) mapping [Multi frame processing approach] + 
3.  Security Analysis (per event) + Real time update (noti (email/cell) )
4.  Log maintance + Retrival 
5. Unified Log generation --> Log retrival and context mapping (clubbing similar events) (eg - blue ford entered 2 times today) 
6. Report generation (Per event/time basis) 

Points to Understand
1. Cross-Domain (Indexing) 
2. VLM scripts, LangChain agent code
3. Setup and running instructions (Not possible as limited time
